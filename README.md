# Mobile Usage Statistical Analysis

## Overview
This project delivers a comprehensive statistical analysis of mobile usage data, covering factors like screen time, app usage, installed applications, and data consumption. The findings offer insights into user behavior patterns and device performance metrics, valuable for understanding device efficiency and user engagement.

## Key Findings
- **Average App Usage Time**: Android users average 4.47 hours per day on apps, while iOS users average 4.70 hours.
- **Highest Battery Drain**: The Google Pixel 5 shows the highest average battery drain, whereas the Samsung Galaxy S21 has the lowest.
- **Screen-on Time**: The user with the highest screen-on time logs approximately 12 hours of daily screen use.
- **Correlation**: There is a positive correlation between the number of installed applications and daily data usage.

## Data Visualization
Visualizations included in this project:
- **Bar Chart**: Displays the average battery drain across different device models.
- **Line Chart**: Illustrates the correlation between the number of installed applications and total data usage per day.

## Future Work
Potential expansions and improvements include:
- Broadening the dataset to cover additional devices and diverse user groups.
- Adding analyses focused on user demographics and app categories to identify usage patterns.
- Building interactive dashboards and data exploration tools to facilitate deeper analysis.
